### Why do we ask questions?
To doubt is a reason to seek clearance, guidance about a specific thing. It could be about why 2+2 = 4 and why not 5? Reasoning is an innate ability of human-beings. It helps to dissect and assemble jumbled pieces to understand something. It could be as trivial as _"Why do we need oxygen to survive?"_ or as complex as understanding about functioning of the universe to which we are nothing but a grain of sand. 

### Humans: God's finest creation
Even though humans are nothing compared to the vast and unending universe, we sure are capable of making amazing things happen. Take a _satellite_ for example, it's capable of transmitting audio signals, video signals, and above all connect us humans to each other via internet. Yes, land and sea based fibre optics cable place a larger role in interconnection and enabling internet services. However, satellites are utilized as a mass communication tool- broadcasting information such as, news, commercials and entertainments such as, tv-shows, and movies. It is the ability of mankind to persevere and reason which made possible for many of the discoveries and innovations possible.

Reasoning also made possible of uncovering facts that earlier seemed to be truth, but later proven to be wrong. For example, for a long time in history it was believed that the universe was viewed as _geocentric_. However, it was challenged by many minds including **Galileo**. This invoked the **Church** (authority, or government in historic times) to keep Galileo under house-arrest and banning of all the books about _heliocentrism_ by Galileo and others. It is due to the reasoning ability, the growth of science took place and as cluster of events, innovations; contributing to the bloom of economic growth around the world during the mid 18th century.

### Egalitarianism: Empowerment of women
During the **French Revolution**, a sense of nationalism arose throughout France. Many writers contributed to this via questioning the unjust ruling of the King of France of the populace. Driven by inequalities, economic crisis and enlightenment ideas, eventually demands for liberty, equality and fraternity resulting in overthrowing of monarchy. During the revolution, women played important role along with the men, which started a way of empowerment of women. This could very well be noticed during the **rise of nationalism** in India. 

Social reformists such as, **Raja Ram Mohan Roy**, **Jyotirao Phule**, **Savitribai Phule**, **Ishwar Chand Vidyasagar**, and many more took it as a chance to take a stance for the welfare of women after reading about various revolutions around the globe. Furthermore, they took action by promoting and pushing for _widow remarriage_, _inter-caste marriage_, _abolishment of sati_ (burning of a widow along the pyre of her husband) along with various derogatory practices performed against women and _education_. **Savitribai Phule** instituted first female school to promote female literacy. This marked upheaval of women status in the Indian society. During this time, promoting equality was undertaken by spreading awareness about the conditions and treatment of **dalits** (depressed classes) beautifully called as **harijan** (people of god) by **Mahatama Gandhi**. 

**Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar** was delegated responsibility to draft the Indian Constitution within the Constituent Assembly. Took various measures to empower the status of _depressed classes_ to which he belonged to, which was formalized by signing of the **Poona Pact** between **Dr. B.R. Ambedkar** and **Mahatma Gandhi** and even incentivizing them by providing reservations in various parts of the public services, public educational institutions and elections, be it of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. Moreover, reservations for women was provided in the subsequent constitution amendments.

### Science: Ultimate source for answers?
While science could be the answer for many of the questions and yet it is difficult to answer few things such as, existence of universe, be it **_spore theory_** or **_the big bang_ theory**. It's wonderful that the universe is balanced perfectly. If there's to be even a slight change even in trajectory of the earth revolving around sun, could be the reason for eradication of entire existence and also possibility of it. Thus, it can be believed that the balance of universe, and it's working is and probably has been taken care by a superior entity or God, which science isn't equipped to debunk yet.

### Conclusion: What's right and what's not?
While existence of God and many other things like after-life can't be debunked yet with the help of science, it plays a vital role in the functioning of our life. From quick access to information, weather status, checking up on a friend or family member to flying around the globe in matter of hours, it all has been made possible with constant reasoning, and innovation. All made possible by science. It is essential to lead life with scientific temperament, questioning things rather than walking with blind faith.
